# Python-Algo-Trading-Bot
Python algorithimic trading bot for Alpaca Brokerage.

Creates a object oriented framework for running multiple investing strategies, as well as one defined investment strategy that attempts to profit from day traders who generate too much momentum around mean reversions. This is not intended for high frequency trading, so websockets and multi-threading were not used.

This requires an account with Alpaca Brokerage and associated API keys for their paper trading account. 

This version of the code is only meant for educational purposes and is not meant as investing advice.
